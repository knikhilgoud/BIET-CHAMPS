:  In general, deaf people have difficulty incommunicating with others who do not understand sign language. Even those who dospeak aloud typically have a “deaf voice” of whichthey are self-conscious and that can make themreticent. The Hand Talk glove is a normal, clothdriving glove fitted with flex sensors. The sensorsoutput a stream of data that varies with degree ofbend made by the fingers. Flex sensors are sensorsthat change in resistance depending on the amountof bend on the sensor. They convert the change inbend to electrical resistance - the more the bend,the more the resistance value. The output from thesensor is converted to digital and processed byusing microcontroller and then it responds in thevoice using speaker[1]. In this project we have useda microcontroller, a speech IC and also speaker toproduce the output. Hardware Components usedare Microcontroller (ATMega 328P), LCD display(16x2), flex sensors, Power supply and Voice ICAPR 9600 as shown in figure . Software used isKiel U vision, Embedded „C‟, Express PCB andISP. It is used in medical applications, wheel chairdirection controlling and robotics.
